# flapjack-icinga2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sol1/flapjack-icinga2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/sol1/flapjack-icinga2)

A client for Icinga 2's [Event Streams API](http://docs.icinga.org/icinga2/latest/doc/module/icinga2/chapter/icinga2-api#icinga2-api-event-streams) feature (first added in Icinga v2.4.0), which connects to Redis and places events on Flapjack's events queue.

This is loosely based on Flapjack's [httpbroker](https://github.com/flapjack/flapjack/blob/master/libexec/httpbroker.go), although that acts as a HTTP server running to receive callbacks while Icinga 2 expects a long-polling HTTP client to receive event data streamed over a long-lived HTTP 1.1 connection.

It only triggers on 'CheckResult' and 'StateChange' event types; Flapjack is built to expect a regular heartbeat of events, and display the changed result outputs. The other events aren't really useful in a distributed notification environment, as Flapjack handles downtime, notification etc.

## INSTALLATION

This API client is written in Go; you'll need Go 1.5+ installed on the machine you are building on. The `build.sh` [script](https://github.com/sol1/flapjack-icinga2/blob/master/build.sh) compiles a standalone binary (in `bin/flapjack-icinga2`) which can be run on other machines without external dependencies.

You'll also need to [set up API access for Icinga 2](http://docs.icinga.org/icinga2/latest/doc/module/icinga2/chapter/icinga2-api#icinga2-api-setup) if you haven't already. The API user you will be using for this client will need to have (at a minimum) permission to access the correct event types:

```
/*
 /etc/icinga2/conf.d/api-users.conf
*/

object ApiUser "username" {
  password = "password"
  permissions = [
    { permission = "events/checkresult" },
    { permission = "events/statechange" }
  ]
}
```

These permissions may be filtered if you want to limit the full range of events that would otherwise be received.
